            MS Dhoni was born to Pan Singh and Devki Devi in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand), on July 7, 1981. He is the only skipper in cricket history to have taken home every ICC trophy. He was selected for the 1997/98 Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship and did well there thanks to his outstanding wicketkeeping, which made him the Commando Cricket Club's regular wicketkeeper (1995–1998). He held a position as a TTE for South Eastern Railway in Midnapore, West Bengal, from 2001 to 2003. He first represented Bihar and then the Jharkhand Cricket team in domestic cricket in India. Three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a few half-centuries in other competitions were among Dhoni's accomplishments during the 2002–03 season. He gained worldwide popularity for his low-order contribution and hard-hitting batting style.
